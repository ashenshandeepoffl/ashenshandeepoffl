My name is Ashen Shandeep and I am currently studying for a degree in Software Engineering. 
I continue my education with the determination to become a Front-end developer.

External activities during school hours, such as athletics, debate championships, as an announcer 
and as the school's students deputy head leader, and also as a sports leader, have brought me many of the 
highest qualities a leader possesses. There are qualities like working with a team, doing my job diligently, 
being a leader and working as a leader.

I'm working as a volunteer to protect the environment and the animals 
we live in and to do my best to help children who have difficulty in education, 
such as children who have problems with education due to lack of money or family problems. 

Thank you.
Ashen Shandeep.
